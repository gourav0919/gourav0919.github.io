// The JavaScript which i write is generally working on the top and left position the idea of inputing the snake target position in a array in that you can work also 
// and creating a game loop and then repainting it every time is also a good idea of working 
// generally i used setTimeout inside the requestanimationframe to achieve the FPS or animation time control but repainting the screen in every animation frame is also a good idea ;
// This is all summary about this project i am happy that you tried to make it by yourself but making the array of objects u can implement in your project then this  work fine 

// More features that you can add is :- 
// showing 3 highest score of user 
// or adding users in game user 1 or user 2 
// and that one increase when the eaten can also be deal 
// or some more features are requested if anyone want to tell !!!!!



// // we know that call back function can not accept arguement but when we call requestAnimationFrame then this return a integer of seconds
// function animation(ctime){
//     // Calling this again create a game loop and we are going to use it 
//     // request animation frame is better because of no flicker and no frame skips and also CPU friendly
//     // This is going to render very fast but you can able to control FPS
//     window.requestAnimationFrame(animation);
//     // console.log(performance.now());
//     // console.log(ctime);

//     // This is for controlling FPS
//     // ctime gives the milliseconds when we run this callBack 
//     // after dividing with 1000 it converts it to seconds 
//     // now we can use this to perform a operation after some time 
//     // this will going to run recursively and you know the recursives calls are very fast i think 
//     // if this time is greater than 4 seconds then this will go else it can not go next 
//     // if((ctime-lastPaintTime)/1000 < 4){
//     if((ctime-lastPaintTime)/1000 < 1/speed){
//         return;
//     }

//     // assigning ctime to last paint time so that next time this will run after the time is fulfilled you understand i think what i want to say
//     lastPaintTime = ctime;
